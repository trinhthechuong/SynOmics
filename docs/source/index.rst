Welcome to SynOmics documentation!
===================================

**SynOmics** is a Python library for synthetic genomics and omics data analysis. 
It provides tools for generating synthetic genomic data, analyzing biological sequences, 
and integrating with bioinformatics workflows.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Abstract
--------

SynOmics is a comprehensive framework for generating and evaluating synthetic omics data. 
The library consists of three main modules:

1. **Preprocessing Module**: Data cleaning, normalization, and preparation for synthetic data generation
2. **Synthesizer Module**: Multiple state-of-the-art synthesis methods including CT-GAN, TVAE, Gaussian Copula, SynthPop, and Avatars
3. **Evaluation Module**: Comprehensive assessment tools for both utility and privacy preservation of synthetic data
